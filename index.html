                <p>I graduated with a degree in English from Illinois State University in 2013. Since then, I have worked in a call center for a financial start up, worked for a coupon website, briefly ran my own online publication focused on local music, and traveled the world. I also play music and have been in bands such as Meristems, Bedspreads, Mishu, and more.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I am currently enrolled in a coding bootcamp. So far I have learned HTML, CSS, Git, Bootstrap and look forward to dedicating all of my free time to learning how to master these skills. My career goal is to not have a boss and to be a freelance designer. This is my longterm goal, and in the shortterm I hope to get a job that will allow me to refine my skills and to gain valuable experience within the industry.</p>
